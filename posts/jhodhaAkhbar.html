      <i>Jodhaa Akbar</i>&nbsp;is instead a sweeping romance of love across
      faiths, overcoming scheming interlopers, and hitting the arranged-marriage
      jackpot. The film doubles down on the religious tolerance for which
      Akbar's reign is rightfully famous. He opened the administration of his
      empire up to bureaucrats of any religion, and abolished faith-based
      pilgrim taxes. He pursued alliances across faiths and invited allied
      nobles to join his court. He joined his Hindu wives in worship and
      celebration. His&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibadat_Khana"

      The film does not double down on the intelligence of Jodhaa, who is lovely
      and "spirited" in the "she can do xyz as well as any man" way. But being
      proud is not the same thing as being interesting. It is definitely&nbsp;<a
        href="https://twitter.com/potus?lang=en"
        >not the same thing as being smart</a

      indication that Jodhaa is interested in anything besides Akbar. Unless you
      count that scene where she is playing with rabbits? And rabbits are really
      more a metaphor than an interest.<br />

      Hritik Roshan, one of the most famous (and famously handsome) Hindu actors
      in Bollywood was chosen to the play the role of Akbar, romantic Muslim
      hero who isnt a terrorist. Given that the Hindu-right loves to use the
      fear of the sexuality of Muslim men as a dog whistle (much like fears of
      the sexuality of men of color is used as a dog whistle in the U.S.), the
      casting choice was either brave of Roshan or cynical on the part of the
      filmmaker, who got to have it both ways. He's a hero but also really
      Hindu, its fine!<br />
      <br />
      Roshan's casting as Akbar was excellent, regardless of motivation. His
      Urdu deserves special praise. His accent is delicious. The locations,
      costumes, and music are sumptuous proof that if money cant buy happiness,
      it can sure buy a whole lot else.&nbsp;<a

      >&nbsp;provided the jewelry for the film, which likely cost a king's
      ransom all on its own. The music, by A.R. Rehman, again draws on the
      variety of musical styles on the Subcontinent for inspiration, including
      dervishes and Hindu religious music, as well as the more contemporary
      "Jashn-e-Bahara".<br />

        The film lasts more than 3 hours, so I wont try to describe the plot. It
        is an epic film, so there is a lot of plot. It is loosely based on
        history, punctuated by some things that actually happened in a way that
        may have vaguely resembled the way they happened on screen. This film is
        about myth-making, and if the myth in question takes religious tolerance
        (albeit limited to Hindu/Muslim tolerance) as its jumping off point,
        that isn't the worst thing. Khuda knows there are far more dangerous
        myths. The disappointment comes from the fact that if the film was going
        to be mostly fiction anyway, it could have done a lot more.<br />
        <br />
        Particularly since there were protests against the film throughout North
        India anyway. These were ostensibly about historical inaccuracy but
        unsecretly about the fact that the&nbsp;<a

        over-acting? Yes. Was Ashwaria Rai underutilized? Yes. Did the film need
        to include Akbar taming a wild elephant? Debatable-
        <a href="https://art.thewalters.org/detail/35955">even if it is true</a
