      It is difficult to imagine a version of Hamlet in which the eponymous
      character fades into the snowy background; a compelling Hamlet woos, he
      murders, he soliloquizes, he sees dead people. However, in&nbsp;<a

      (2003), manages to match the explosive inner conflict of Hamlet/Haider to
      the explosive conflict in Kashmir in the

        href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1399992/A-brief-history-of-the-Kashmir-conflict.html"
        >mid-1990s</a
      >, and Haider's story is eclipsed by the conflict that subsumes his life.
      The brilliant white of Kashmir in winter is a white of purity and burial
      shrouds, of bleached skulls and frozen rivers. It highlights the soot and
      blood of war.

      <br />
      <br />
      In this retelling, Haider (played by a committed
      <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1372788/">Shahid Kapoor</a>) is a
      student of poetry who returns to Kashmir after the disappearance of his
      father into the hands of the Indian Army. He finds a house in ruins and a
      home destroyed as his mother Gertrude/Ghazala (<a
        href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0007102/"
        >Tabu</a
      >) has turned to his uncle Claudius/Khurram Meer (<a
        href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1946407/?ref_=tt_cl_t4"
        >Kay Kay Menon</a
      >) for refuge. Haider's childhood sweetheart Ophelia/Arshia (<a
        href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3601766/"
        >Shraddha Kapoor</a
      >), a journalist, joins Haider in his quest to find his father.<br />
      <br />
      As Haider pursues his search and become entangled with militants who claim
      to know where his father is buried, he descends deeper into paranoia.
      Neither Haider nor the viewer is entirely sure what happened or who to
      trust. This paranoia is present in the play, but what makes this retelling
      different is that the truth is in many ways irrelevant- thousands of
      militants and civilians disappeared in Kashmir in the 1990s. If not
      Haider's father, then plenty of others. If not Haider, then someone else.
      If Haider is crazy, then so is everyone and everything else in his world.
      Kashmir is a pressure cooker, and the lid is the&nbsp;<a

      >&nbsp;(AFSPA).<br />

        </div>
        But if Haider's life is defined by the&nbsp;AFSPA, Ghazala and Arshia
        are additionally limited by the men around them. <i>Haider</i> is
        unusual for the time and love spent on fleshing out Ghazala and Arshia-
        both are characters of strength and depth, backed into corners&nbsp;by a
        patriarchy which limits their options and forces them to make impossible
        choices- and then punishes them for taking those same impossible
        choices. Ghazala is a wife and mother with no control over the decisions
        made by her husbands or her son. Arshia is a journalist who can cover
        events but has no ability to change the outcome. Haider only sees their
        desperation after it is too late, and their final decisions are tragic
        but inevitable.&nbsp;<a
