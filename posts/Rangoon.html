    War films fall into two categories: thoughtful films about the ethics of
    taking human life, and nationalist rallying cries about why you shouldn't
    think about it too hard.&nbsp;<i

    >(2017) is the second sort of war film. Also a love triangle. That is also a
    metaphor for imperialism? Also a movie about the film industry. And probably
    some other things as well- there is a lot going on.<br />
    <br />
    <i>Rangoon</i> is set during WWII, when the British Army (including large
    numbers of South Asian soldiers) are fighting both the Axis powers and the
    Axis-aligned pro-independence Indian National Army (INA), based out of South
    East Asia and led by&nbsp;<a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subhas_Chandra_Bose"
      >Subhas Chandra Bose</a
    >. There is not a Gandhian in sight, even though in the mid-1940s Gandhi was
    very much in the mix. Don't think about it too hard.<br />
    <br />
    <i>Rangoon</i> stars the multi-talented&nbsp;<a

    but don't think about it too hard.<br />

    Miss Julia is involved with studio scion and former stuntman Rusi Billimoria
    (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0451307/?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm"
      >Saif Ali Khan</a
    >). After being threatened with financial ruin by Major General David
    Harding (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0564500/">Richard McCabe</a>)
    Rusi agrees to send Julia to the Indo-Burmese border to boost morale.
    Jemadar Nawab Malik (<a
      href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1372788/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1"
      >Shahid Kapoor</a
    >) acts as Miss Julia's bodyguard during the trip, while simultaneously
    serving as a spy for the INA.<br />
    <br />
    En route to Burma, Miss Julia's convoy is attacked by the Japanese, and she
    is thrown into the river and washed away, along with Jemadar Malik. They
    take a Japanese soldier (<a
      href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5223819/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t18"
      >Satoru Kawaguchi</a
    >) captive and begin the long slog together back to the nearest British
    camp. Over the course of the journey Miss Julia and Jemadar Malik fall in
    love and Shahid Kapoor fails to dance in the rain even though it rains and
    there is dancing. Because 2017 was a stupid year, so why not make everyone a
    little extra bummed out.<br />

    Their chemistry also isn't what it could be. Shrug. Nevertheless, Jemadar
    Malik is portrayed as the better romantic option because, unlike Rusi, he
    doesn't literally own her. He also lies to and uses her throughout, but
    don't think about it too hard.<br />
    <br />
    <i>Rangoon</i> has a lot going for it, including a massive budget.
    <a
      href="https://in.bookmyshow.com/entertainment/movies/the-journey-of-kangana-ranaut"
      >Kangana Ranaut</a
    >&nbsp;steals every scene and makes the most of a

      href="https://feminisminindia.com/2017/02/26/feminist-film-review-rangoon/"
      >pretty hollow character</a
    >. The scenery and cinematography is beautiful and the earliest songs are
    charming throw-backs to the winking, performative numbers the golden age of
    musicals is known for. They are tremendous fun.&nbsp;

  <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
    <br />
    Ultimately, insomuch as&nbsp;<i>Rangoon</i> is a war film, it is a war film
    about the INA. And the&nbsp;<i>realpolitik</i>&nbsp;of the INA-
    "the<i>&nbsp;</i>enemy of my enemy is my friend"- is difficult to swallow
    when the friend in question is&nbsp;the world's most famous genocidal
    racist. It's a problem that the strident nationalism of <i>Rangoon</i> is
    unconcerned with exploring. British Major Harding is a caricature, Jemadar
    Malik is a hero, don't think about it too hard. Certainly critical thinking
    the last thing nationalist rulers want.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

    >Finding George Orwell in Burma</a
  >&nbsp;is a fascinating travel book about Orwell's formative years and the
  ways in which the mind is besieged under dictatorships. Perhaps more
  frightening is how quickly those of us living in democracies willingly embrace
  easy narratives.&nbsp;<i>Rangoon</i> is a perfectly acceptable film, and
  better than most- if you don't think about it too hard.<br />
