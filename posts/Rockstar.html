    <i>Rockstar</i> (2011), like all stories about rock stars, is a story of
    self-discovery, an inevitable rise, and an inevitable fall. Although
    predictable, <i>Rockstar</i> has some moments of beauty and poses some
    questions worth exploring.<br />
    <br />
  </div>
  The story is fairly straightforward: Janardhan Jakhar, aka J.J., aka Jordan
  (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1633541/" target="_blank"
    >Ranbir Kapoor</a
  >), the titular rock star, is told that to become a real artist he needs to
  experience pain. As he had a happy childhood it will have to come in the form
  of a broken heart. After a friend, watching Heer (<a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nargis_Fakhri"
    target="_blank"
    >Nargis Fakhri</a
  >) dance, comments that she is a ‘heart-breaking machine’, he decides to make
  a pass at her. He falls flat, but through persistence strikes up a friendship
  with her.
  <br />
  <br />
  <div>
    This in itself is problematic, as the message to men is clearly “no means
    try harder.” And, “when in doubt, try stalking.” <br />
    <br />
  </div>
  However unlikely, the effortlessly cool Heer and the inarticulate J.J. become
  friends. Heer is soon to be married, so she makes a list of the things to do
  before becoming a good Indian wife and mother- another problematic idea.
  Visiting a Delhi disco, drinking Desi liquor, and sneaking into a “blue film”
  together deepen their bond. At her wedding in Kashmir Heer realizes she is in
  love with J.J. Both make half-hearted remarks about running away together, but
  as neither can tell if the other is serious, Heer marries Aaman.<br />
  <br />
  Heer is whisked away to Prague, leaving J.J., christened Jordan by Heer,
  heartbroken. Also homeless- he has stolen 500,000 rupee from his family to
  attend the wedding in Kashmir, and is kicked out of the house. Finally, some
  suffering! His musical career is due to take off any day now. Sure enough, he
  moves into a Sufi shrine (still places where the homeless can go for shelter
  and the hungry for food) and begins performing
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojIHZqvJpV0" target="_blank"
    ><i>quwwali</i></a
  >
  in the <i>dargha</i>. A famed musician notices Jordan at the shrine and
  eventually helps him secure a contract with a music producer. This in turn
  leads to a musical exchange to Prague, where Jordan and Heer are reunited. The
  affair ends in tears, Jordan’s deportation, and Heer collapsed in her driveway
  after a scene in front of the entire family-in-law. It transpires that Heer
  suffers from a fatal form of anemia, and with her marriage over she returns to
  India to die with her family and, inevitably, Jordan.

  By the end Jordan, like the hero of&nbsp;<i

      href="https://www.amazon.com/Farewell-Arms-Ernest-Hemingway/dp/0684801469"
      >A Farewell to Arms</a
    >, </i
  >is&nbsp;free to drink, fight, and drug himself to death, responsible to and
  for no one - a rockstar in the mold of his idol, Jim Morrison,&nbsp; Heer
  predicted Jordan would never be able to live outside their shared world, and
  by the end it is evident that she was absolutely right. Heer’s role in the
  film is that of disposable muse, catalyst of Jordan’s life and career but in
  control of neither her own feelings nor her own fate.&nbsp; Film audiences
  deserve better heroines than Heer. Unfortunately for the
  character,&nbsp;Fakhri is also pretty mediocre in this role, particularly in
  contrast to Kapoor, who is fantastic.&nbsp;

  <span style="font-family: inherit;"
    >In the ‘plus’ column, A.R. Rahman’s music is incomparable as always. Above
    you can find the beautiful qawwali-inspired ‘Kum Fayakun’, my personal
    favorite. However, all the songs are solid and blend beautifully into the
    story. The choreography is passable. The cinematography is better than
    average, with some epic shots of Rome and Prague, as well as gorgeous shots
    of Kashmir. Kashmir not at war, but at a wedding, which is better. The story
    jumps across time via montages a few times over the course of the film,
    which also makes for engaging viewing.</span

  Chakravarty (1993) calls the Hindi film industry the site where, “the
  overriding official goal of Indian national unity is subject to the work of
  cultural elaboration,” where, “cinematic culture...can then be seen as a
  mediated form of national consciousness.”<span class="MsoFootnoteReference"

    >&nbsp;If this is the case, what can we learn from <i>Rockstar</i>?
    <i>Rockstar</i>&nbsp;certainly aspires to a global&nbsp;cosmopolitanism.
    Jordan is adored by fans throughout the world, as evidenced by his
    popularity in Rome and Prague, as much as in Lucknow and Delhi.&nbsp;</span
  ><br />
  <span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><br /></span>
  <span class="MsoFootnoteReference"
    >Moreover, by participating in both Hindu and Muslim celebrations, Jordan
    demonstrates his ability to embrace diversity within India. Unity through
    diversity! Jordan is western in his aspirations- he idolizes Jim Morrison
    rather than a playback singer in the Indian film industry or Ravi Shankar.
    Jordan also resists the expectations of his family and society more broadly-
    he rebels his way to international stardom, although he experiences intense
    suffering along the way. The ending of the film is ultimately ambiguous:
    what is the price of international fame? What is the price of art? Of love?
    The price is high- maybe too high- but can the rush toward the dreamed-of
    globalization be stopped? Is the journey more important than the
    sorrow-filled destination?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span

    >As a finale note, Heer wears gorgeous Kashmiri shawls throughout the
    film.&nbsp; I include a picture below of the Kashmiri shawl I bought in
    Lucknow for my mother for a heart-breaking $36 from a Kashmiri gentleman
    selling textiles door-to-door. This should give you, dear reader, a sense of
    the exquisite handiwork which set Kashmiri textiles apart.&nbsp;</span
