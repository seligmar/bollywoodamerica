  (what many consider India's first film,
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raja_Harishchandra"
    ><i>Raja Harishchandra</i></a

  all of them including

  >&nbsp;(1975) and
  <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mughal-e-Azam">Mughal-e-Azim</a> </i

  List of Lists. More accurately, my top-10 destinations for information about
  Hindi cinema. <br />

  A UCLA project highlighting different facets of South Asian arts and culture,
  this site has some interesting biographies, film summaries, and analysis,
  primarily of Hindi/Urdu cinema, but not exclusively. The&nbsp;<a

  <a href="http://bethlovesbollywood.blogspot.com/">Beth Loves Bollywood</a
  ><br />
  <br />
  Self explanatory, except that Beth loves the Bangla-language cinema of
  Tollywood as much as anything else, which is fantastic. It is not easy to find
  good reviews of Bangla-language films in English. Her blog is an entertaining
  and entirely worthwhile read.<br />

  Another of Beth's projects, this blog showcases the worst costume choices ever
  made in Bollywood, Tollywood, and Kollywood. This is a blog I never knew the
  internet always needed. I had never stopped to really consider just how
  gloriously awful some of these costumes are. Now we all can. <br />

  This is a reservoir of thoughtful, articulate reflections on Hindi-language
  cinema, the role of cinema in globalization, and the cultural significance of
  Hindi-language cinema in the UK's South Asian diaspora communities. I like to
  dip into this site when in need of inspiration or insight.<br />

    <br />
    For coverage of South Asian and global cultural happenings, fashion trends,
    current events, who's who, and of course cinema, told with sophistication
    and elan, look first to Vogue India. Look no further.

    Exactly what is says on the label: A curated take on South Asian art,
    literature, life and news. The voices found on The Aerogram are generally
    breezy and opinionated, and easily digestible. Amusement and thinking
    ensues.<br />

    Despite the punny name choice, Dr. Philip Lutgendorf's blog, which is linked
    to his course offerings at the University of Iowa, is far more intellectual
    than mine. For that I resent his blog a little bit, but it is worth reading
    nevertheless.<br />

    This is actually a youtube chanel, but it is a great place to find
    high-quality, legal (ie not pirated) prints of old films for free! This is a
    particularly good option because,
    <a href="http://ww2.kqed.org/arts/2014/09/12/netflix_streaming_dvds/"
      >as columnist Jon Brooks so aptly noted</a
    >, Netflix is not always the place to go for the esoteric and interesting.
    This is particularly true of Netflix streaming, which is mostly crap,
