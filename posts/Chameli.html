      Putting reservations aside, I really like this film. The structure of the
      first forty minutes resembles&nbsp;<i>Waiting for Godot </i>if Godot
      moonlighted as a mechanic;<i>&nbsp;</i>Chameli (<a
        href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004626/?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm"
        >Kareena Kapoor</a
      >) and Aman (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0097893/?ref_=tt_cl_t2"
        >Rahul Bose</a
      >), trapped under awning by the rain, converse while Chameli avoids her
      pimp's and his customers' thugs and Aman tries to find someone to repair
      his water-logged car. Various characters from the city's marginalized
      communities pass through, including a chai-seller, Haseena, a

      and her lover, Haseena's lover's political father, and corrupt police
      officers; political criticisms are made with straight-forward sympathy for
      India's poor. The criticisms are made with about as much subtlety as
      <i>Oliver Twist, </i>but hey, it worked for Dickens, and when is the last
      time you saw a film with a <i>hijra</i> who wasn't just an amusing
      cultural trope? (<a

      The other advantage of the structure of the first half is the ease with
      which a language-learner can follow the dialogue. Two people, speaking
      slowly and clearly about relatively simple things is the dream of every
      cinephilic language-learner;&nbsp;<i>Chameli</i> was the first
      Hindi-language film I watched <i>sans</i> subtitles, and for that alone
      this film&nbsp;will always have a special place in my heart.<br />
      <br />
      The second half of the film is less engaging. Chameli and Aman chase
      around the city trying to tie up loose ends and keep Chameli out of the
      clutches of the violent and diseased man from whom her pimp has taken an
      advance. Money changes hands, Aman's eyes are opened, and an&nbsp;<a

      more than once she can take care of herself. We believe her, although
      everyone acknowledges that Aman's money and connections are handy things.
      When I re-watch this film, I often skip most of the second half and jump
      right to the end.<br />

        The music and choreography, especially of "Bhaage Re Mann" is pretty
        inane. Dancing in the rain is a popular trope, but not even

        standing water of India's monsoons in the middle of Mumbai. Like all
        fans of musicals, I am willing to suspend a lot of disbelief, but for a
        practical woman, Chameli makes impossibly dumb choreographic choices.
        Kareena Kapoor also sings, in her own voice, earlier in the film, and
        then there is the voice of a playback singer 20 minutes later.<br />

        If there is one final argument in favor of <i>Chameli</i>&nbsp;it is
        this: the film openly acknowledges violence against women. Granted, it
        acknowledges violence against women in the context of sex work, but
        remember- <i>Devdas</i>, <i>Pakeeza</i>, <i>Umrao Jaan</i>-
        they&nbsp;all tell the stories of <i>tawaiif</i> from a deeply masculine
        perspective, full of poetry, mirrors, brocades and virtuous doomed love.
        <i>Chameli </i>is not interested in telling the title character's doomed
        love story, and while <i>Chameli</i> appropriates the voice of sex
        workers, at least it has something to say that cuts a bit closer to the
        bone of women's lives than
        <i

            >Pyaasa</a
          >&nbsp;</i
        >(1957). <br />
        <br />
        <i>Chameli</i> puts it out there: violence against women and girls is
        very real, and the question presented to Aman, and by extension the
        audience, is "Why are you still pretending to be surprised?". Aman helps
        Chameli out of a bind- but whether or not he can or will change her
        life, and if she will really want the kind of help he offers, is left
        open. But unlike Pakeeza, it seems very likely Chameli will continue
        drinking, smoking, and swearing for as long as she has fight left in
        her. Nevertheless, she persists.<br />
