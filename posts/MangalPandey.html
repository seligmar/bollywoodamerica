        While at a bus stop in the middle of nowhere
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan">Rajasthan,</a> a very
        old woman saw my friend and I and asked if the British had returned.
        Although the people at the bus stop laughed at her, I was struck by the
        incongruity of her question, or rather, by the distance between us. It
        was sometimes easy to forget that the Raj ended more recently than WWII-
        but maybe only for me.

          >depicts the First Anglo War in Afghanistan</a
        >, despite the terrible cost in human life and the importance of the
        conflict to regional and world history. This film is based on the
        real-life figures of Mangal Pandey and Col. Gordon Ramsey, who both
        served in Afghanistan and were actors on the South Asian stage in the
        conflict 1857, although liberties have obviously and openly been taken.

        For readers not familiar with the events of 1857 (alternately called the
        Sepoy Rebellion and the First War of Independence) the basic facts are
        as follows- in 1857 the East India Company (EIC) introduced new
        cartridges which were greased with the fat of hogs and cattle,
        <i>haram</i> and sacrilegious for Muslim and Hindu sepoys respectively.
        This, combined with many other concerns, not the least among them being
        the EIC annexation of Oudh in 1856, resulted in a series of uprisings
        against the EIC in central and northern India, the first beginning in
        the cantonment in Meeruit on May 10 of 1857. The EIC reasserted control
        in India with the fall of Gwalior on June 20, 1858. Bahadur Shah Zafar,
        the last Mughal ruler of Delhi, was deposed and sent into exile in
        Rangoon, Burma, and the Crown assumed control of the subcontinent,
        establishing the British Raj. Queen Victoria was crowned Empress of
        India in 1877.

        established. The song <i>"</i>Rasia<i>" </i>juxtaposes the private
        relationship between Jwala and Ramsey and the public lives of Pandey and
        Heera. I dont know why Jwala cries (maybe she wanted the lights on), but
        by the end of the sequence the Bollywood taboo of including anything
        particularly explicit –and outside of marriage, no less- has been
        flaunted, albeit with the bodies of a virginal widow and a Catholic
        Scottish colonialist. The song's entire sequence is notable for the
        extreme sexualizing of India's nomadic peoples- the two women dancing
        together is particularly lacking in subtly. I have long believed
        orientalism in Bollywood film (<a

        be a good place to start.

        The song "Main Vari Vari", in addition to being catchy, is consequently
        a problematic reflection on the public gaze. The viewer is watching
        Heera, but the viewer is also watching the EIC watch Heera. The viewer
        is meant to condemn the leering men visually consuming the body of a
        slave, who is singing about the deadly power of her beloved's gestures;
        but while the viewer is condemning the EIC, we are equally guilty of
        viewership. However, this self-reflexive judgement is completely absent
        in the objectification of the Indian tribal women dancing during the
        erotic <i>"</i>Rasia<i>"</i>. Is objectification acceptable, or isnt it?
        The film seems to answer "it depends on the women." &nbsp;&nbsp;

        There are other problems with the film. The music is not up to A.R.
        Rahman's usual standards. There is a
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzjQnaStWV0">Holi scene</a>,
        complete with song and dance. Why is there a Holi scene, complete with
        song and dance? Why not, I guess, although it seems cruel to make Toby
        Stephens dance. There are some explicit moments between Pandey and
        Heera, which seem more-or-less gratuitous.

        Yes- British cruelty, personified by one of Ramsey's fellow EIC
        officers, is on full rabid display. I am curious as to what he thinks
        colonial rule looks like. More to the point, Pandey's caste-hatred for
        his untouchable neighbor is on equally rabid display. The EIC is shown
        to be inherently unjust-therefore, it must be dismantled, by violence if
        necessary. But if the resulting world is to be more just than the one
        ruled by the EIC, so too must caste hierarchies be torn down. Pandey
        cannot be the leader the sepoys (and occupied India) needs until he
        learns to overcome his own prejudices.
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph-div">
        An even bolder rejection of prejudice is made in Pandey's choice of love
        interest. Heera is a slave
        and&nbsp;<i>tawaiff,&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;therefore a completely unsuitable
        wife for explicitly upper-caste Pandey. In a region where marriage,
        women's sexuality, and caste boundaries are rigidly intertwined, a
        national hero marries an explicitly lowest-caste sex worker- and a
        mouthy one at that. Given the high premium placed on the purity of
        national heroes everywhere, this choice is nothing short of shocking.

        Ramsey's choice of widow Jwala is less controversial. He was a white
        colonial&nbsp;and she was a virginal widow saved from sati; neither are
        invested in the caste system's purity strictures or concerned with the
        sanctity of Hindu marriage. More interesting is the film's approach to
        the issue of
        <i
          ><a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/wwh/modules/lesson5/lesson5.php?s=0"
            >sati</a
          ></i
        >
        (also transliterated as <i>suttee</i>) itself. When Ramsey and Pandey
        see a funeral complete with sati in the works, it is Ramsey who insists
        on intervening; Pandey is shown reluctant to get involved in ending the
        outlawed tradition, just as Ramsey was reluctant to get involved in the
        slave trading he witnessed.&nbsp;Both men have some learning to do along
        their path to becoming national heroes. However, on the issue of
        sati&nbsp;Ramsey- and by extension the EIC- is shown to be in right.
        More than a battle of Indians vs. Britishers, this film explores the
        battle of justice against injustice, in all forms and from all sides.
        The romance in this film is not about intimacy or dancing. It is about
        social politics.

        As to the preachy criticism... well, yes. It gets a bit preachy. The
        messages could have been more subtle; but given that the
        <i>Times </i>reviewer missed most of them, perhaps it is best they were
        not. Do not be dissuaded-&nbsp;<i>Mangal Pandey: The Rising</i>
        is ultimately an extremely entertaining celebration of national myth,
        with solid performances by beautiful people in beautiful settings to
        beautiful music. The solidly progressive, if somewhat heavy-handed,
        messages should be viewed as an added incentive.

        As a final note, although it is certainly a nice touch to have Heera
        join the fight with her very own violence (hooray agency!), I am still
        waiting for a film about India’s real-life female freedom fighters.
        There are some films about modern-day women terrorists, including

        movements could be fascinating and inspiring.
