    >&nbsp; (2004), streaming with subtitles on Netflix, is one of the modern
    classics to come out of Bollywood in the 2000s. Graced with three big stars,
    driven by an entertaining, if predictable, plot, and laced through with
    beautiful music and some interesting messages, the film was a hit with
    domestic and overseas audiences alike.</span

    The film opens with a dream sequence, which quickly breaks to an aged and
    frail Veer (<a
      href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0451321/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1"
      target="_blank"
      >SRK</a
    >) in one of the largest cells ever to misrepresent a prison system. We
    discover Veer is an Indian political prisoner in Pakistan, and has not
    spoken since his arrest. A young and idealistic lawyer, Saamiya Siddiqui (<a
      href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0611552/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0"
      target="_blank"
      >Rani Mukerji</a
    >),&nbsp;appears on the scene with one goal: to secure the Indian prisoner’s
    freedom. No one that handsome could be a spy (James Bond notwithstanding);
    Veer is naturally innocent of all wrongdoing. But to prove it, Saamiya is
    going to need to hear the whole story. Eventually convinced of his lawyer's
    sincerity, Veer recounts his tale of love and loss while gently cradling a
    silver anklet of bells.&nbsp;
  </div>
  <br />
  In the flashback of Veer's memory, which comprises most of the film, we are
  introduced to our heroine, headstrong Pakistani girl Zaara, played by the
  ever-delightful
  <a
    href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006689/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0"
    target="_blank"
    >Priti Zinta</a
  >. After the death of her beloved teacher, Zaara&nbsp;travels to India to pour
  her ashes into the Sutlej river in the Punjab. There, Zaara is rescued by
  Veer, a handsome Indian air force pilot, who agrees to accompany Zaara to the
  Sutlej, and then show her his home. As all great couples should, the two fall
  head-over-heels in love over the course of two days to a beautiful score
  composed by Madan Mohan. <br />
  <br />
  <div class="MsoNormal">
    Not all is to run smoothly- Veer is obviously in jail. As with all great
    melodramas, this film has a dastardly villain, some cruel twists of fate,
    and a phenomenal courtroom scene. I won't share the ending- suffice to say,
    it is very melodramatic. At its best, this film is moving melodrama. At its
    worst, this film is ridiculous melodrama. However, one must respect that
    this film is completely unafraid to be exactly what it is.
    <br />
    <br />

  <div class="MsoNormal">
    With the self-assuredness comes some heavy-handedness. Women deserve equal
    opportunities to pursue educations and futures! Cross-border, religiously
    mixed love is beautiful! True love conquers all! In case of confusion, these
    points are driven home with the subtly of a semi-truck. Fortunately, that
    doesn’t make the messages wrong, and the film, while heavy-handed, makes a
    nice change from some of the other messages about love, diversity, and
    gender relations coming out of Hollywood, Bollywood, and most everywhere
    else.

    <div style="text-align: left;">
      The music is some of the best you will ever hear. I enjoy all the songs-
      one I include here in which Veer describes India to Zaara, who rejoins
      that her homeland shares the same dawn and sunset with India. It is
      joyful, patriotic, and romantic- a trifecta of greatness. Please also
      appreciate the over the course of his career, SRK has danced on everything
      imaginable, including the Ferris wheel here (see also

  Another song worth noting is “Main Yahaa Hun” (I am here), Zaara’s fantasy,
  displaying the chemistry between Zinta and Khan and Zaara’s unapologetic
  interest. Very often in films I cant help but wonder if the heroine is dancing
  along just to be nice. Make no mistake here- Zaara is in it to win it. Veer
  even appears in the rain following the ever-popular trope which highlights the
  object of desire’s figure and form. The male form as desired, and the heroine
  doing the unabashed longing, is unusual. SRK
  <a href="http://www.rediff.com/movies/2004/oct/18srk.htm">commented</a> that
  he has done enough romantic films to sleepwalk through roles. Looked fine to
  me.&nbsp; &nbsp;

  <br />
  <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 12pt;">
    The costuming on this film is lovely, showcasing old-fashioned elegance for
    a more contemporary moment. While trends in shalvar suits and sari come and
    go, beautiful lines, bejeweled dupata and solid colors will never cease to
    appeal to those with an eye for the timeless. <br />

    Critical to enjoying <i>Veer-Zaara</i> is checking cynicism at the door. If
    by the end of this film you aren’t in tears and convinced Veer and Zaara
    will be together forever, you are watching it wrong. Gray areas, ambiguity-
    reality in general- have no place here. Leave it at home or don’t bother
    watching. And don’t bother calling- I will be busy happily crying and
    singing along.<br />
